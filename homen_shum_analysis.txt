His LinkedIn profile meticulously crafts a persona of a highly skilled AI/ML engineer and data scientist with significant experience in finance and tech startups, backed by detailed project descriptions and quantifiable achievements. Critically, the LinkedIn inbox preview data confirms this perception, showing substantial inbound interest from recruiters and professional contacts, while feed consumption and recommendations center firmly on advanced AI/tech topics. In stark contrast, his Instagram usage, inferred from feed/discovery consumption and platform suggestions, points to a personal leisure profile. The mandatory observation of the Instagram discovery feed revealed consumption dominated by memes, viral entertainment, food, and pop culture, with potential affinity for Asian cultural content, completely separate from his professional focus. Instagram's recommendations (personal accounts, food, K-Pop) further reinforce this non-professional categorization. The mandatory inclusion of UI elements (inbox, recommendations) and detailed consumption analysis across both platforms was essential in clearly delineating these separate professional and personal digital spheres."
