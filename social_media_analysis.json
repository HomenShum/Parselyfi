Instagram, conversely, appears to be used primarily for personal entertainment and consumption of informal content, including humor and memes. This indicates an intentional separation between professional branding and personal interests. The algorithms likely categorize the user differently on each platform based on this distinct usage pattern. For future account setup or optimization, maintaining this dual approach with tailored content and tone per platform seems appropriate, focusing on core identity elements like AI/ML, Finance, and Projects on professional networks, while allowing for broader interests on others. The detailed LinkedIn profile and its featured projects are key elements to maintain."
