The analysis is particularly valuable for investors, homebuyers, and businesses making capital expenditure decisions, as it provides detailed projections for interest rate movements that will influence financial markets throughout 2025. The timing is especially relevant as it comes amid improving inflation data that has given the Fed more flexibility after a restrictive policy stance throughout 2023-2024."
