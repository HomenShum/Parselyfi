**Ultimate Generalized Social Media Profile Analysis Prompt (Platform-Specific Schemas & MANDATORY UI Element Extraction)**

**Objective:** To conduct an exhaustive, multi-faceted analysis of the online presence for `[Target Individual/Profile Name]` based *exclusively* on the provided detailed data extractions from the following social media platforms: `[List of Platforms Analyzed, e.g., LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook, TikTok, Reddit, etc.]`. This analysis **mandates** the inclusion of data extracted directly from specific user interface elements (Inbox/DM Preview, Network/Follower Tabs, Recommendations) and aims to generate an extremely detailed report. The report will synthesize their projected persona(s), skills/expertise/interests, engagement patterns, cross-platform consistency, potential professional profile (if applicable), relevant market/trend insights (if applicable), a detailed enumeration and analysis of their individual connections (where provided), **and a critical analysis derived from the mandatory capture of suggested/recommended entities presented by the platform's interface.** The output **must** conform to the platform-specific JSON schema structure defined below.

**Critical Input Data Requirements:**
*   **The following data points derived directly from the user interface during observation are MANDATORY inputs for this analysis where the corresponding UI elements are present and visible on a given platform. Failure to provide this data if visible will result in an incomplete analysis for that platform:**
    *   **A. Inbox / Direct Message Sidebar / Messaging Preview Data:** Detailed list of individuals/conversations visible in the direct messaging inbox preview (or equivalent interface element). Capture **full names**, visible message snippets, timestamps (if shown), status indicators (e.g., unread, sponsored), and any other displayed details precisely as they appear.
    *   **B. My Network / Connections / Followers Tab Visibility Data:** Detailed list of individuals, companies, or other entities prominently displayed within the dedicated "My Network," "Connections," "Followers," "Following," or equivalent sections (beyond just simple counts). Capture **full names/titles**, brief context provided by the platform (e.g., "shared connection," "attended same event," "recent activity," "follows you"), and any associated details shown.
    *   **C. Platform Suggestions & Recommendations Data:** Comprehensive capture of *all* explicitly labeled "Recommended," "Suggested," "People Also Viewed," "People You May Know," "Who to Follow," "Discover," or similarly identified entities presented by the platform. This includes suggestions shown on profile pages, feeds, sidebars, dedicated recommendation areas, or within network tabs. Capture entity type (person, page, company, group, event, topic, hashtag, sound, etc.), **full name/title**, headline/description/snippet, URL (if possible), and any stated reason for the suggestion (e.g., "From your school," "Because you follow X," "Popular"). Note the location context where the suggestion appeared.
*   **In addition to the mandatory UI elements above, the input data MUST also include, where available on the specific platform:**
    *   Profile fundamentals (username, name, bio, location, links, profile picture/banner descriptions, verification status, etc.)
    *   Skills, interests, tagged topics, hashtags used in bio
    *   Detailed experience, education, projects sections (especially for professional platforms)
    *   Activity logs (posting frequency, content types - posts, tweets, reels, stories, videos, comments, shares, reposts/retweets - specific post examples)
    *   Engagement data (likes/reactions, comments given/received, shares/retweets, saves, views)
    *   Network information (follower/following counts and overall characteristics, group/community/subreddit memberships)
    *   A detailed list of individual connections/followers/following (name, URL, headline, etc.) for the `detailedConnectionsList` field (if obtainable and ethically permissible).
    *   Observed content consumption (feed content, explore/discovery/For You page themes and examples)
    *   Usage of platform-specific features (Stories highlights, Reels tabs, Twitter Spaces, Lists, Fleets (archived), TikTok Duets/Stitches, Reddit AMAs, etc.)
    *   Privacy setting indicators (e.g., public, private, protected tweets)

**Important Considerations & Disclaimer:**
*   **Data Acquisition:** The responsibility for acquiring this data, including the mandatory UI element extractions and connection lists, lies entirely with the entity providing the input. This prompt assumes the data *has been* accurately and ethically obtained according to platform Terms of Service and privacy regulations. Automated scraping is often prohibited and risky.
*   **Privacy & Ethics:** Ensure you have the legitimate right and ethical justification to possess and process all provided data, especially detailed connection lists and UI captures.
*   **Scalability:** Analyzing large volumes of connection or recommendation data can be intensive.

**Instructions:**
Generate a comprehensive analytical report on `[Target Individual/Profile Name]`, leveraging *every specific detail* available in the provided data for *each* platform analyzed. Connect information across platforms and data types wherever possible. **Crucially, the analysis MUST heavily incorporate and explicitly reference the data extracted from the mandatory UI elements (Inbox/DM Preview, Network/Follower Tab Visibility, Platform Suggestions/Recommendations) specific to each platform.** These elements are considered primary signals for understanding network context and algorithmic perception. Structure the report according to the **platform-specific JSON schema structure** defined below, ensuring all requested fields within the relevant platform schema are populated with maximum detail derived *only* from the input data.

**The analysis within the report structure MUST cover (synthesized across relevant platform sections):**

**I. Platform-Specific Deep Dives (Using the dedicated schema for EACH platform analyzed):**
    *   Analyze all fields within the specific JSON schema defined for that platform (e.g., use the `linkedInProfileAnalysis` schema for LinkedIn data, `instagramProfileAnalysis` for Instagram data, etc.).
    *   Ensure all mandatory UI element data (`inboxSidebarPreview`, `myNetworkTabVisibility`, `platformSuggestions` and their associated analyses) are thoroughly populated and analyzed within the context of that platform.

**II. Cross-Platform Synthesis & Holistic Analysis:**
    *   **A. Consistency versus Variation:** Compare profile elements, content, tone, persona *across all analyzed platforms*.
    *   **B. Content Overlap & Strategy:** Identify cross-posting and infer strategy.
    *   **C. Synthesized Expertise & Interests:** Create unified list of skills/interests.
    *   **D. Overall Online Persona Narrative:** Construct overarching impression.
    *   **E. Professional Evaluation (Conditional):** Assess professional profile using data primarily from platforms like LinkedIn, informed by network/recommendation data.
    *   **F. Market/Trend Insights (Conditional):** Identify key tech/topics/trends informed by activity, consumption, network, and recommendations across platforms.
    *   **G. Inferred Algorithmic Perception:** Based on *all* data, **with strong emphasis on the mandatory UI element extractions specific to each platform**, hypothesize how *each* platform's algorithm categorizes the user. Explicitly link recommendations to the hypothesis for each platform.
    *   **H. Cross-Platform Network Analysis:** Identify overlapping connections/recommendations. Compare network/recommendation composition across platforms.

**III. Final Comprehensive Summary:**
    *   Provide a concise (one-to-two paragraphs) high-level summary consolidating the most critical findings, **specifically highlighting the insights derived from the mandatory UI element data across platforms**, the interplay between platforms, and the overall synthesized impression.
